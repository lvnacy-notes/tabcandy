 * Candy, rather than each constructing the same setViewState() call

 *
 * Awaits `revealLeaf()` after `setViewState()` - Obsidian's own docs
 * recommend this to guarantee the view has actually finished loading
 * (rather than sitting behind an internal placeholder while backgrounded)
 * before anything else touches the leaf. Cheap, and effectively a no-op

 * `registerEvent` is passed in rather than this function registering
 * directly on `app.workspace`, matching `registerBackgroundVaultWatchers()`'s
 * convention in `src/services/backgrounds.ts` - the caller's own
 * `Component.registerEvent()` (auto-cleaned up on unload) is what actually
 * owns the returned `EventRef`, not this function.
